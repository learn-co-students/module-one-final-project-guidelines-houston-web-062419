## Navigating the Database
Welcome to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry! This database was made with the intention of showing new students the important relationship between students, houses, and what we call values - your personal principles and most distinctive traits. Students may peruse this database while waiting to be sorted into houses to get a grasp of the history of each houses and some of their notable members.

  - Each value belongs to a student and to a house.
  - A student has many values.
  - A house has many values.
  - Through values, a student has many house-options and a house has many students-options.

Begin your house-sorting search by selecting one of 4 options: - Search by student - Search by house - Search by value - Exit the database
