## Navigating the Database
Welcome to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry! This database was made with the intention of showing new students the important relationship between students, houses, and what we call values - your personal principles and most distinctive traits. Students may peruse this database while waiting to be sorted into houses to get a grasp of the history of each house and some of their notable members.

  - Each value belongs to a student and to a house.
  - A student has many values.
  - A house has many values.
  - Through values, a student has many house-options and a house has many students-options.

Begin your house-sorting search by selecting one of 4 options: - Search by student - Search by house - Search by value - Exit the database

## Option One â€“ Accio Student Information
Upon selecting this option, you'll be given the opportunity to input a fellow student's name and receive their email address. 

## Option Two - Accio House Information
Upon selecting this option, you'll be given the opportunity to input a house name and receive information about that house. 

## Option Three - Accio Value Information
Upon selecting this option, you'll be asked to choose from a list of values. After choosing which one you embody the most, you will receive information regarding which house may fit you best and the name of a fellow student that has been in that house. Go back to the student information function to receive that person's contact information or the house information function to receive information on that house. 

## Option Four - Update Student Information
Upon selecting this option, you'll be given the opportunity to update a student's email address. 

## Option Five - Report Student
Upon selecting this option, you'll be given the opportunity to report a student for the improper use of magic. After inputting the student's name, that student will be deleted from the database so that other students are not unintentionally put in contact with them. 

## Option Six - Exit
Choose to exit the database or return to the main menu. 

That's it! Have fun learning more about Hogwart's houses, your fellow students, and yourself! Now hurry before the sorting hat ceremony begins. Have a great school year!
